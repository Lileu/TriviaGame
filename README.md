JavaScript Assignment 2

https://lileu.github.io/triviagame/

## Built with
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. jQuery

## Stuff I used
* css reset file (Meyerweb Reset)
* giphy gifs

## Stuff I learned
* When pseudocoding, decompose by technical functionality instead of process/ui (contrary to BA approach)
* How to insert debuggers into code and use inspector to debug/step through JavaScript and jQuery scripts
* I need to block out a couple of days this week to revisit Javascript because my lack of understanding is a huge impediment to my progress/efficiency currently
